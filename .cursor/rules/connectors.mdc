# Sandgarden Connectors

- Sandgarden functions use connectors to interact with external services like databases, LLMs, and APIs.
- Connectors can be loaded from the sandgarden runtime using `sandgarden.get_connector('connector-name')`
- Connectors will return a client for the service specified. For example, a connector to an OpenAI model will return a client for the OpenAI SDK.
