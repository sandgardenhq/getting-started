# Sandgarden commands
Some times you will need to interact with the Sandgarden service where workflows are hosted and deployed. You can do this using the `sand` command line utility.
- Sandgarden commands all follow a similar structure `sand <resource> <action>`
- The comman actions are:
    - create -- creates a new version of the resource
    - get -- fetch a particular instance of a resource
    - list -- list all resources of this type
    - tag -- alias a version to a tag
    - delete -- delete a resource
- For example, `sand prompts create --content <path to file> --name <name>` will register a prompt with sandgarden. You can then load it using the Sandgarden library.
