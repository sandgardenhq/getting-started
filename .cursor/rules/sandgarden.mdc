Sandgarden is a cloud platform to build and deploy AI applications.
There are two ways to execute code in Sandgarden functions and workflows.

# Resources
- [functions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/functions.mdc)
- [workflows.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/workflows.mdc)
- [prompts.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prompts.mdc)
- [connectors.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/connectors.mdc)

## Versioning 
- All resources are all versioned
- Versions can be tagged. For example `myFunction:3` could be aliased to `myFunction:production`
- When creating a version of resource tag it
- When associating resources in Sandgarden refer to them by tag rather than by version

## Project Structure
- **Clear project structure** workflows are all included in sub-directories of /workflows named the name of the workflow
- All workflow and step names are kebab case or snake case
- Steps are all in the steps directory of the workflow
- Steps are numbered sequentially in order of execution with a four digit number like 0001, 0002, etc.
- Steps are named <SEQUENCE NUMBER>-<STEP NAME> like this 0001-my-first-step
- The following code block is an outline of the directory structure of a workflow
    ```
    /workflows                                      # all workflows go here
    /workflows/my-workflow                          # the base directory for my-workflow
    /workflows/my-workflow/worfklow.json            # the configuration for my-workflow           
    /workflows/my-workflow/steps                    # the steps for my-workflow           
    /workflows/my-workflow/steps/0001-first-step    # all code for the step goes here          
    /workflows/my-workflow/steps/0001-first-step/prompts        # any prompts for the step go here, they are plaintext files and maybe named <prompt_name> or <prompt_name>.txt          
    /workflows/my-workflow/steps/0001-first-step/input.json     # OPTIONAL: input schema for the step         
    /workflows/my-workflow/steps/0001-first-step/output.json    # OPTIONAL: output schema for the step         
    /workflows/my-workflow/steps/0001-first-step/config.yml     # OPTIONAL: a configuration file for the step         
    ```
- This code block shows the structure on the step config.yml file
    ```yaml
    #  All fields are optional
    name: The name of the step
    description: A description of the step
    connectors:
    - list of connector names
    tags:
    - list of tags to apply
    ```
- **Modular design** use distinct files for services and utilities.
