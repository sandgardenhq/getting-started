# Sandgarden Workflows

- Workflows coordinate many functions. See [sandgarden-functions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/sandgarden-functions.mdc)
- If a workflow requires input us an input schema. The schema should be the same as the input schema of the first function called by the workflow.
- Specify an output schema for the workflow. Always use the output schema of the last function invoked by the workflow.
- Workflows have no code of their own only configuration
