# Getting Started with Sandgarden

Sandgarden is a platform to prototype, iterate, and deploy AI applications. It eliminates the overhead of:

1. Configuring and creating pipelines for AI tools and processes
2. Setting up secure testing environments for your data
3. Managing the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of production applications

It takes away overhead of configuring and creating a pipeline of all the tools and processes you need to even begin testing AI securely with your data, in your environment. Then it makes it easy to turn a prototype into a production application without having to figure out how to deploy, monitor, and scale the stack.
